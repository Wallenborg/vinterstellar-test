      <h3>Space Systems Engineer</h3>
      <p>
        We’re looking for a Space Systems Engineer to join Vinterstellar AB and
        help us and our partners develop satellites and space systems. You’ll
        take a leading role in shaping architectures, coordinating subsystems,
        and making technical decisions that make a difference — both on Earth
        and in space.
      </p>
      <h3>About Vinterstellar</h3>
      <p>
        At Vinterstellar, we develop space technology, establish space-based
        infrastructure, and contribute to scientific research — all with the
        goal of expanding humanity’s understanding and use of space. In the long
        run, we want our work to help make human life in space a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a startup with a solid customer base and a stable financial
        foundation — combining the agility and creativity of a young company
        with the reliability of an established one. We work closely, support
        each other, and share responsibility. Ideas grow in the group, and
        you’ll be involved from the early idea to final delivery. What matters
        is creating value — where and how you work is something we define
        together.
      </p>
      <h3>Your Role</h3>
      <p>
        You’ll work closely with our clients — leading players in satellite
        development and space innovation — to help define, build, and verify
        their systems. Your role will be to understand the big picture, align
        the parts, and ensure everything works as one.
      </p>
      <h3>What You’ll Do</h3>
